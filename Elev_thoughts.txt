Programming language: Go
Communication method: Message-passing

Modules:
	- Networking
	- State machine
		- Stores the state of all connected elevators
		- Calculates the cost functions
	- I/O
		- Read button input
		- Control the elevator
		- Control button panel lights
		
The modules will be split into threads. These will have their own "main" functions, which again will call all other needed functions. Goal: Make sure no two threads ever call the same function.
