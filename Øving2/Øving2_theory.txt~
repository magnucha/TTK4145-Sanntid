An atomic operation is an operation which actually just requires one operation. (Unlike i++, which requires 3).
To implement an atomic operation, one has to go all the way down to hardware-level.

A semaphore is a variable which cannot be reduced below 0. They are used as a flag to control access to a shared resource.
A binary semashore can only take the values 0/1, and a counting semaphore can take all integer values >0.
